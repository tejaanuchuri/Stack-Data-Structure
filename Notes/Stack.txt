Stack : 

    1. Is a Linear Data Structure.
    2. which follows a particular Order may be LIFO OR FILO.

Implementation of stack:
    1. Using Array.
    2. Using Linkedlist.

How to understand a stack practically? 

    1. There are many real-life examples of a stack.
    2. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen.
    3. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, 
       i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time.
       So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO/FILO order.

Time Complexities of operations on stack:

    1. Push()   =>  o(1)
    2. Pop()    =>  o(1)
    3. isEmpty()=>  o(1)
    4. top()    =>  o(1)
    5. size()   =>  o(1)

Applications Of Stack:

    2. Infix toa Postfix
    3. Redo-undo
    4. forward and backward feature in web browser.
    5. tree travesals
